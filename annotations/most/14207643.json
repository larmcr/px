It was focused on practical applications in routine medical practice. We provide practical recommendations for ten different clinical situations, that have either been approved or not approved by regulatory agencies. We propose some comments that might accompany the results of these tests, indicating the best drug and doses to be prescribed. The discussed examples include KRAS, cetuximab, panitumumab, EGFR-gefitinib, CYP2D6-tamoxifen, TPMT-azathioprine-6-mercaptopurine, VKORC1/CYP2C9-warfarin, CYP2C19-clopidogrel, HLA-B*5701-abacavir, HLA-B*5701-flucloxacillin, SLCO1B1-statins and CYP3A5-tacrolimus. We hope that these practical recommendations will help physicians, biologists, scientists and other healthcare professionals to prescribe, perform and interpret these genetic tests.","type":"article","volume":"12","xrefs":[{"id":827784030,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21174626","xrefId":"21174626"},{"id":1449263440,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2217%2Fpgs.10.147","xrefId":"10.2217/pgs.10.147"}],"year":2011},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA124","symbol":"CYP2C19","name":"cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA126","symbol":"CYP2C9","name":"cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA128","symbol":"CYP2D6","name":"cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA131","symbol":"CYP3A5","name":"cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA7360","symbol":"EGFR","name":"epidermal growth factor receptor"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA35056","symbol":"HLA-B","name":"major histocompatibility complex, class I, B"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA30196","symbol":"KRAS","name":"Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA134865839","symbol":"SLCO1B1","name":"solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 1B1"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA356","symbol":"TPMT","name":"thiopurine S-methyltransferase"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA133787052","symbol":"VKORC1","name":"vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443560","name":"Breast Neoplasms"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443622","name":"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443756","name":"Colonic Neoplasms"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443815","name":"Crohn Disease"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443936","name":"Drug Hypersensitivity"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443937","name":"Drug Toxicity"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA444320","name":"Graft vs Host Disease"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA444417","name":"Hemorrhage"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA444997","name":"Muscular Diseases"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA445019","name":"Myocardial Infarction"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA162263533","name":"nephrotoxicity"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448004","name":"abacavir"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448500","name":"atorvastatin"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA10040","name":"cetuximab"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA449053","name":"clopidogrel"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA134687924","name":"erlotinib"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA164781042","name":"flucloxacillin"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA131301952","name":"gefitinib"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA162373091","name":"panitumumab"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA142650384","name":"pitavastatin"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451089","name":"pravastatin"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA134308647","name":"rosuvastatin"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451363","name":"simvastatin"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451578","name":"tacrolimus"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451581","name":"tamoxifen"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451906","name":"warfarin"}]},"publication":{"id":14207643,"resourceId":"21174626","title":"Practical recommendations for pharmacogenomics-based prescription: 2010 ESF-UB Conference on Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics.","authors":["Becquemont Laurent","Alfirevic Ana","Amstutz Ursula","Brauch Hiltrud","Jacqz-Aigrain Evelyne","Laurent-Puig Pierre","Molina Miguel A","Niemi Mikko","Schwab Matthias","Somogyi Andrew A","Thervet Eric","Maitland-van der Zee Anke-Hilse","van Kuilenburg André Bp","van Schaik Ron Hn","Verstuyft Céline","Wadelius Mia","Daly Ann K"],"journal":"Pharmacogenomics","month":1,"page":"113-24","pubDate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21174626","summary":"The present article summarizes the discussions of the 3rd European Science Foundation-University of Barcelona (ESF-UB) Conference in Biomedicine on Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics, which was held in June 2010 in Spain.

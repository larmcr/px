In Asians, the thiopurine-induced toxicity is not completely explained by TPMT variants. Literature indicates that a newer genetic variant in nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15) gene is associated with thiopurine intolerance. We aimed to determine the risk allele frequency of NUDT15 genetic variant and its association with thiopurine-induced toxicity in Indian patients.\n\nMETHODS: In this pilot study, 69 patients on thiopurine therapy were analyzed. The frequencies of thiopurine-induced leukopenia were recorded. NUDT15 (C415T) and TPMT (*2, *3A, *3B, and *3C) genotyping was performed using amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Results were validated by DNA sequencing.\n\nRESULTS: The NUDT15 CC, CT, and TT genotypes were found to be 86.9%, 11.5%, and 1.5%, respectively, whereas TPMT genetic variants were absent. Of 60 patients without NUDT15 variant, none developed leukopenia, whereas of nine patients with NUDT15 variant, six developed leukopenia (P-value < 0.0001). The mean thiopurine dose of 1.01 and 0.73 mg/kg/day for patients with wild and mutant NUDT15 alleles, respectively, was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity for NUDT15 variant were 100% and 95.2%, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The NUDT15 risk allele frequency was 7.2%. There are 6/69 (8.7%) patients who developed leukopenia and harbored NUDT15 variant, thus showing a strong association for thiopurine-induced toxicity. Hence, NUDT15 genotyping may be considered before thiopurine therapy in Indian patients.","type":"article","volume":"32","xrefs":[{"id":1449292196,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27416873","xrefId":"27416873"},{"id":1449292197,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fjgh.13494","xrefId":"10.1111/jgh.13494"}],"year":2017},"related":{"GENE":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA134963132","symbol":"NUDT15","name":"nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif 15"}],"DISEASE":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443750","name":"Colitis, Ulcerative"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443815","name":"Crohn Disease"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446861","name":"Hepatitis, Autoimmune"}],"CHEMICAL":[{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"}]},"variantAnnotations":[{"cases":69,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"azathioprine","url":"/chemical/PA448515"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1448124075,"literature":"27416873","literatureUrl":"/pmid/27416873","phenotypeCategories":["toxicity"],"pvalue":"0.0001","race":"Indian","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]},{"cases":69,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"azathioprine","url":"/chemical/PA448515"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1448124080,"literature":"27416873","literatureUrl":"/pmid/27416873","phenotypeCategories":["dosage"],"pvalue":"0.01","race":"Indian","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]}]}

Screening for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphisms will prospectively identify approximately 10% of patients. Recently, a polymorphism in the inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase gene (ITPA) has been associated with severe azathioprine toxicity. We demonstrate here that this proline to threonine substitution at codon 32 in the ITPA gene is found at low frequency in Central/South American populations (1-2%), at a constant frequency across Caucasian and African populations (6-7%), and is highest in Asian populations (14-19%). This data is consistent with previously described allele frequencies in other Caucasian (7%), African (5%), and Asian (11-15%) populations.

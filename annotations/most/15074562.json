Despite their efficacy, some patients may have a poor response due to inability to achieve adequate levels of the active metabolite, 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). Others experience hepatotoxicity, which correlates with excessive 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) levels. Two adult studies have demonstrated successful manipulation of thiopurine metabolism with allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, to achieve more optimal thiopurine levels. The aim was to retrospectively characterize the utility of allopurinol to optimize thiopurine metabolite levels in pediatric IBD patients.\n\nMETHODS: Thirteen patients received allopurinol daily (100 mg in patients >or=30 kg and 50 mg <30 kg), and their thiopurine dose was simultaneously reduced to 25%-50% of the previous maintenance dose. Metabolite levels and other screening labs were checked 2-4 weeks later.\n\nRESULTS: The mean azathioprine dose was decreased from 148.1 to 59.6 mg daily (60% of the mean original dose). The mean 6-TGN level increased from 173 to 303 pmol/8 x 10(8) red blood cell count (RBC) (P = 0.03), and the mean 6-MMP level decreased from 7888 to 2315 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC (P < 0.001). Elevated transaminase levels improved or resolved in all patients. Two patients experienced reversible neutropenia. At the conclusion of the study 9 patients (69%) remained on combination therapy with a mean duration of follow-up of 162.8 +/- 119.2 days.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy successfully shunted thiopurine metabolites to a more favorable pattern. Reversible neutropenia was the most common side effect (2 patients). Long-term prospective studies are needed in this patient population.","type":"article","volume":"14","xrefs":[{"id":1449280663,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18521913","xrefId":"18521913"},{"id":1449280664,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fibd.20522","xrefId":"10.1002/ibd.20522"}],"year":2008},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446116","name":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA445113","name":"Neutropenia"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448320","name":"allopurinol"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA452634","name":"purine analogues"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451663","name":"thioguanine"}]},"publication":{"id":15074562,"resourceId":"18521913","title":"Initial clinical experience with allopurinol-thiopurine combination therapy in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.","authors":["Rahhal Riad M","Bishop Warren P"],"journal":"Inflammatory bowel diseases","month":12,"page":"1678-82","pubDate":"2008-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18521913","summary":"BACKGROUND: Thiopurines are a mainstay of immunomodulator therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

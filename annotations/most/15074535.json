Changes in levels of each individual TGN - 6-thioguanosine mono-, di- and triphosphate (6-TGMP, 6-TGDP, 6-TGTP) - and of 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotides (6-MMPR) after 5-ASA are not known.\n\nMETHODS: Effects of increasing 5-ASA doses on AZA metabolites were investigated prospectively in 22 patients with inflammatory bowel disease in 4-week study periods. Patients started with 2 g 5-ASA daily, and then were increased to 4 g daily and followed by a washout period. Thiopurine doses remained unchanged throughout the entire study. Levels of 6-TGMP, 6-TGDP, 6-TGTP and 6-MMPR as well as of 5-ASA and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA) were determined each study period.\n\nRESULTS: Median baseline levels in 17 patients of 6-TGDP, 6-TGTP and 6-MMPR were 52, 319 and 1676 pmol per 8 x 10(8) red blood cells respectively. After co-administration of 2 g 5-ASA daily, median 6-TGDP and 6-TGTP levels increased but median 6-MMPR levels were unchanged. Increasing 5-ASA to 4 g daily did not affect median 6-TGDP and 6-TGTP levels, but median 6-MMPR levels decreased. After discontinuation of 5-ASA, both 6-TGDP and 6-TGTP levels decreased and median 6-MMPR levels increased. The 6-TGTP/(6-TGDP+6-TGTP)-ratio did not change during the study, but 6-MMPR/6-TGN ratios decreased.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Individual 6-TGN metabolites increased after addition of 5-ASA, but 6-MMPR-levels and the 6-MMPR/6-TGN ratios decreased. Further studies are needed to decide whether this pharmacokinetic interaction would result in improvement of efficacy and/or increased risk of toxicity of AZA.","type":"article","volume":"160","xrefs":[{"id":1449280650,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20590602","xrefId":"20590602"},{"id":1449280652,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1476-5381.2010.00731.x","xrefId":"10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00731.x"},{"id":1449280651,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2936018","xrefId":"PMC2936018"}],"year":2010},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446116","name":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450384","name":"mesalazine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA452634","name":"purine analogues"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451663","name":"thioguanine"}]},"publication":{"id":15074535,"resourceId":"20590602","title":"Influence of 5-aminosalicylic acid on 6-thioguanosine phosphate metabolite levels: a prospective study in patients under steady thiopurine therapy.","authors":["de Graaf P","de Boer N K H","Wong D R","Karner S","Jharap B","Hooymans P M","Veldkamp A I","Mulder C J J","van Bodegraven A A","Schwab M"],"journal":"British journal of pharmacology","month":7,"page":"1083-91","pubDate":"2010-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20590602","summary":"OBJECTIVE: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) raises levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN), the active metabolites of thiopurines such as azathioprine (AZA).

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency is known to exacerbate thiopurine toxicity. However, many patients are highly sensitive to thiopurines for unknown reasons. We show that multidrug-resistance protein 4 (Mrp4) is abundant in myeloid progenitors and tested the role of the Mrp4, an ATP transporter of monophosphorylated nucleosides, in this unexplained thiopurine sensitivity. Mrp4-deficient mice experienced Mrp4 gene dosage-dependent toxicity caused by accumulation of 6-TGNs in their myelopoietic cells. Therefore, Mrp4 protects against thiopurine-induced hematopoietic toxicity by actively exporting thiopurine nucleotides.

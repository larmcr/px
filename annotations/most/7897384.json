All patients were rigorously followed up for at least 2 years (mean time, 11.5 years). A case-control analysis of MDR1 G2677T/A and C3435T SNPs and 2 loci haplotypes in 112 steroid-dependent CD patients treated with azathioprine was performed. Patients were classified on the basis of response to azathioprine.\n\nRESULTS: A total 76 patients treated with azathioprine for longer than 3 months were included. Remission was achieved in 42 CD patients (55.3%). A higher frequency of the 2677TT genotype was found in nonresponders than in responders (17.65% versus 7.14%; OR = 2.8; 95% CI; 0.6-12.1; P = 0.11). Nonresponders to azathioprine were found to have a higher frequency of the 3435TT genotype than did CD patients who had achieved clinical remission (17.64% versus 4.76%; OR = 4.3; 95% CI, 0.8-22.8; P = 0.06). The 2677T/3435T haplotype was also more abundant in nonresponders (29.4% versus 20.2%), whereas the 2677G/3435C haplotype was more frequent in responders (58.3% versus 47.1%). Lack of response to azathioprine therapy in CD patients was 1.8-fold greater in carriers of the 2677T/3435T haplotype than in carriers of the 2677G/3435C haplotype (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 0.82-3.9; P = 0.14).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate higher frequencies of the 2677TT and 3435TT genotypes and the 2677T/3435T haplotype in CD patients who did not respond to azathioprine. Additional replications in independent populations would confirm the real impact of these polymorphisms in response to azathioprine therapy.","type":"article","volume":"13","xrefs":[{"id":139302120,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17262810","xrefId":"17262810"},{"id":1449249797,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fibd.20044","xrefId":"10.1002/ibd.20044"}],"year":2007},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA267","symbol":"ABCB1","name":"ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443815","name":"Crohn Disease"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"}]},"publication":{"id":7897384,"resourceId":"17262810","title":"MDR1 polymorphisms and response to azathioprine therapy in patients with Crohn's disease.","authors":["Mendoza Juan L","Urcelay Elena","Lana Raquel","Martín M Carmen","López Natalia","Guijarro Luis G","Mayol Julio A","Taxonera Carlos","de la Concha Emilio G","Peña Amado S","Díaz-Rubio Manuel"],"journal":"Inflammatory bowel diseases","month":5,"page":"585-90","pubDate":"2007-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17262810","summary":"BACKGROUND: To investigate the contribution of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene pharmacogenetics (G2677T/A and C3435T) to the efficacy of azathioprine in inducing remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).\n\nMETHODS: A cohort of 327 unrelated Spanish patients with CD recruited from a single center was studied.

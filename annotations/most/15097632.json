Its mutation may lead to AZA-induced toxicity. The dysfunctional genetic variant TPMT *3C is of low frequency among Asians. Moreover, AZA-induced toxicity still occurs in some patients with normal TPMT activity. This suggests that additional factors, including other genetic variants, may contribute to such toxicity. Recent studies described a strong association between a variant of the NUDT15, a gene that mediates the hydrolysis of some nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, and thiopurine-related myelosuppression in Asians. We report the first case of a Chinese patient with AZA-induced severe toxicity with no clinically significant TPMT variant but with the NUDT15 c.415C>T allele.\n\nMETHODS: A 40-year-old Chinese patient with PBC-AIH overlap syndrome had been receiving for one month, azathioprine (50 mg/day) and methylprednisolone (24 mg/day) based on his TPMT*3C wild-type genotype. The patient developed serious myelosuppression and hair loss. AZA was stopped, and the patient was given liver-protective drugs and supportive treatment. TPMT and NUDT15 gene sequencing suggests that NUDT15 c.415C>T mutation was the likely cause of the adverse reaction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: NUDT15 c.415C>T may be another predictor of AZA-induced leukocytopenia. If further well-controlled studies validate this association with sufficient predictive power, NUDT15 and TPMT genotyping before starting AZA treatment may become appropriate.","type":"article","volume":"41","xrefs":[{"id":1449288828,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27381176","xrefId":"27381176"},{"id":1449288829,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fjcpt.12420","xrefId":"10.1111/jcpt.12420"}],"year":2016},"related":{"GENE":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA134963132","symbol":"NUDT15","name":"nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif 15"}],"DISEASE":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446861","name":"Hepatitis, Autoimmune"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA444799","name":"Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary"}],"CHEMICAL":[{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"}]},"variantAnnotations":[{"cases":1,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"azathioprine","url":"/chemical/PA448515"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1448112623,"literature":"27381176","literatureUrl":"/pmid/27381176","phenotypeCategories":["toxicity"],"race":"Asian","significance":"not stated","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]}]}

The significant SNPs, identified to be involved in AZA response, were subsequently validated by allelic discrimination and direct sequencing. SNP analysis was carried out using the SNPassoc R package and the haploblocks were determined using haploview software.\n\nRESULTS: We studied 127 patients in the discovery phase and 53 patients in the validation phase. We showed that two SNPs (rs8058694 and rs8058696) found in ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6, a subfamily member of ATP-binding cassette genes, constituted a new haplotype associated with AZA response in MG patients in the discovery cohort (P=0.011; odds ratio: 0.40; 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.83) and in the combined cohort (P=0.04; odds ratio: 1.58).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the role that the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 haplotype may play in AZA drug response. In view of the significant effects and AZA intolerance, these novel SNPs should be taken into consideration in pharmacogenetic profiling for AZA.","type":"article","volume":"27","xrefs":[{"id":1449293305,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27922550","xrefId":"27922550"},{"id":1449293306,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2FFPC.0000000000000257","xrefId":"10.1097/FPC.0000000000000257"}],"year":2017},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA58","symbol":"ABCC6","name":"ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 6"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA445004","name":"Myasthenia Gravis"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"}]},"publication":{"id":15098211,"resourceId":"27922550","title":"A novel ABCC6 haplotype is associated with azathioprine drug response in myasthenia gravis.","authors":["Colleoni Lara","Galbardi Barbara","Barzago Claudia","Bonanno Silvia","Franzi Sara","Frangiamore Rita","Camera Giorgia","Foti Maria","Biancolini Donatella","Canioni Eleonora","Maggi Lorenzo","Antozzi Carlo","Mantegazza Renato","Bernasconi Pia","Kapetis Dimos"],"journal":"Pharmacogenetics and genomics","month":2,"page":"51-56","pubDate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27922550","summary":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMETs) with the response to azathioprine (AZA) in patients affected by myasthenia gravis (MG) to determine possible genotype-phenotype correlations.\n\nMETHODS: Genomic DNA from 180 AZA-treated MG patients was screened through the Affymetrix DMET platform, which characterizes 1931 SNPs in 225 genes.

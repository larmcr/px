Its pharmacological action is based on the release of 6-mercaptopurine, but the biochemical processes underlying this biotransformation have remained obscure. In this investigation, human glutathione transferases (GSTs) from seven distinct classes were assayed with azathioprine. GSTs A1-1, A2-2, and M1-1, all abundantly expressed in human liver, displayed the highest activity among the 14 GSTs tested. The uncatalyzed reaction of azathioprine with glutathione was estimated to be less than 1% of the GST-catalyzed biotransformation. GST M1-1 is polymorphic with a frequently occurring null allele, and GSTs A1-1 and A2-2 show variable expression levels in human subjects, implying significant differences in the rate of 6-mercaptopurine release from azathioprine. Individuals expressing high GST activity are apparently predisposed for adverse reactions to azathioprine treatment, both by promoting excessively high concentrations of free 6-mercaptopurine and its toxic metabolites and by depleting cellular glutathione.

However, their molecular mechanism of action is unknown. In the present study, we have identified a unique and unexpected role for azathioprine and its metabolites in the control of T cell apoptosis by modulation of Rac1 activation upon CD28 costimulation. We found that azathioprine and its metabolites induced apoptosis of T cells from patients with Crohn disease and control patients. Apoptosis induction required costimulation with CD28 and was mediated by specific blockade of Rac1 activation through binding of azathioprine-generated 6-thioguanine triphosphate (6-Thio-GTP) to Rac1 instead of GTP. The activation of Rac1 target genes such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), NF-kappaB, and bcl-x(L) was suppressed by azathioprine, leading to a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Azathioprine thus converts a costimulatory signal into an apoptotic signal by modulating Rac1 activity. These findings explain the immunosuppressive effects of azathioprine and suggest that 6-Thio-GTP derivates may be useful as potent immunosuppressive agents in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation.","type":"article","volume":"111","xrefs":[{"id":556513295,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12697733","xrefId":"12697733"},{"id":1449251477,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1172%2FJCI16432","xrefId":"10.1172/JCI16432"},{"id":1449251476,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC152932","xrefId":"PMC152932"}],"year":2003},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA76","symbol":"BCL2L1","name":"BCL2-like 1"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA30584","symbol":"MAP2K1","name":"mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA248","symbol":"NFKB1","name":"nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA34162","symbol":"RAC1","name":"ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (rho family, small GTP binding protein Rac1)"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"}]},"publication":{"id":8616071,"resourceId":"12697733","title":"CD28-dependent Rac1 activation is the molecular target of azathioprine in primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes.","authors":["Tiede Imke","Fritz Gerhard","Strand Susanne","Poppe Daniela","Dvorsky Radovan","Strand Dennis","Lehr Hans Anton","Wirtz Stefan","Becker Christoph","Atreya Raja","Mudter Jonas","Hildner Kai","Bartsch Brigitte","Holtmann Martin","Blumberg Richard","Walczak Henning","Iven Heiko","Galle Peter R","Ahmadian Mohammad Reza","Neurath Markus F"],"journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","month":4,"page":"1133-45","pubDate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12697733","summary":"Azathioprine and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are immunosuppressive drugs that are used in organ transplantation and autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn disease.

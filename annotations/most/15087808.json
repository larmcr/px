We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify comprehensively the genetic basis of MP intolerance in children with ALL.\n\nMETHODS: The discovery GWAS and replication cohorts included 657 and 371 children from two prospective clinical trials. MP dose intensity was a marker for drug tolerance and toxicities and was defined as prescribed dose divided by the planned protocol dose during maintenance therapy; its association with genotype was evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model.\n\nRESULTS: MP dose intensity varied by race and ethnicity and was negatively correlated with East Asian genetic ancestry (P < .001). The GWAS revealed two genome-wide significant loci associated with dose intensity: rs1142345 in TPMT (Tyr240Cys, present in *3A and *3C variants; P = 8.6 × 10(-9)) and rs116855232 in NUDT15 (P = 8.8 × 10(-9)), with independent replication. Patients with TT genotype at rs116855232 were exquisitely sensitive to MP, with an average dose intensity of 8.3%, compared with those with TC and CC genotypes, who tolerated 63% and 83.5% of the planned dose, respectively. The NUDT15 variant was most common in East Asians and Hispanics, rare in Europeans, and not observed in Africans, contributing to ancestry-related differences in MP tolerance. Of children homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15 variants or heterozygous for both, 100% required ≥ 50% MP dose reduction, compared with only 7.7% of others.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We describe a germline variant in NUDT15 strongly associated with MP intolerance in childhood ALL, which may have implications for treatment individualization in this disease.","type":"article","volume":"33","xrefs":[{"id":1449285561,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25624441","xrefId":"25624441"},{"id":1449285563,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1200%2FJCO.2014.59.4671","xrefId":"10.1200/JCO.2014.59.4671"},{"id":1449285562,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375304","xrefId":"PMC4375304"}],"year":2015},"related":{"GENE":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA134963132","symbol":"NUDT15","name":"nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif 15"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA356","symbol":"TPMT","name":"thiopurine S-methyltransferase"}],"DISEASE":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446155","name":"Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"}],"CHEMICAL":[{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"}]},"variantAnnotations":[{"cases":657,"characteristics":"Study Cohort: Children's Oncology Group (COG) AALL03N1","chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"TPMT","url":"/gene/PA356"}],"id":1444703337,"literature":"25624441","literatureUrl":"/pmid/25624441","phenotypeCategories":["dosage"],"pvalue":"8.6E-9","race":"Mixed Population","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs1142345","url":"/variant/PA166156978"}]},{"cases":371,"characteristics":" St Jude total therapy XV protocol (replication cohort)","chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"TPMT","url":"/gene/PA356"}],"id":1444703337,"literature":"25624441","literatureUrl":"/pmid/25624441","phenotypeCategories":["dosage"],"pvalue":"1.8E-8","race":"Mixed Population","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs1142345","url":"/variant/PA166156978"}]},{"cases":657,"characteristics":"Study Cohort: Children's Oncology Group (COG) AALL03N1","chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1444703361,"literature":"25624441","literatureUrl":"/pmid/25624441","phenotypeCategories":["dosage"],"pvalue":"8.6E-9","race":"Mixed Population","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]},{"cases":371,"characteristics":" St Jude total therapy XV protocol (replication cohort)","chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1444703361,"literature":"25624441","literatureUrl":"/pmid/25624441","phenotypeCategories":["dosage"],"pvalue":"0.0024","race":"Mixed Population","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]}]}

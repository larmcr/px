TPMT activity was measured by radiochemical analysis, TPMT genotype was determined by mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses for the TPMT*2, *3A, *3B, and *3C alleles, and thiopurine metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.\n\nRESULTS: Of 23 patients evaluated, six had TPMT deficiency (activity < 5 U/mL of packed RBCs [pRBCs]; homozygous mutant), nine had intermediate TPMT activity (5 to 13 U/mL of pRBCs; heterozygotes), and eight had high TPMT activity (> 13.5 U/mL of pRBCs; homozygous wildtype). The 65.2% frequency of TPMT-deficient and heterozygous individuals among these toxic patients is significantly greater than the expected 10% frequency in the general population (P <.001, chi(2)). TPMT phenotype and genotype were concordant in all TPMT-deficient and all homozygous-wildtype patients, whereas five patients with heterozygous phenotypes did not have a TPMT mutation detected. Before thiopurine dosage adjustments, TPMT-deficient patients experienced more frequent hospitalization, more platelet transfusions, and more missed doses of chemotherapy. Hematologic toxicity occurred in more than 90% of patients, whereas hepatotoxicity occurred in six patients (26%). Both patients who presented with only hepatic toxicity had a homozygous-wildtype TPMT phenotype. After adjustment of thiopurine dosages, the TPMT-deficient and heterozygous patients tolerated therapy without acute toxicity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a significant (> six-fold) overrepresentation of TPMT deficiency or heterozygosity among patients developing dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicity from therapy containing thiopurines. However, with appropriate dosage adjustments, TPMT-deficient and heterozygous patients can be treated with thiopurines, without acute dose-limiting toxicity.","type":"article","volume":"19","xrefs":[{"id":32015847,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11304783","xrefId":"11304783"},{"id":1449245376,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1200%2FJCO.2001.19.8.2293","xrefId":"10.1200/JCO.2001.19.8.2293"}],"year":2001},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA356","symbol":"TPMT","name":"thiopurine S-methyltransferase"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443937","name":"Drug Toxicity"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA445062","name":"Neoplasms"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA452634","name":"purine analogues"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA451663","name":"thioguanine"}]},"publication":{"id":6489593,"resourceId":"11304783","title":"Preponderance of thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency and heterozygosity among patients intolerant to mercaptopurine or azathioprine.","authors":["Evans W E","Hon Y Y","Bomgaars L","Coutre S","Holdsworth M","Janco R","Kalwinsky D","Keller F","Khatib Z","Margolin J","Murray J","Quinn J","Ravindranath Y","Ritchey K","Roberts W","Rogers Z R","Schiff D","Steuber C","Tucci F","Kornegay N","Krynetski E Y","Relling M V"],"journal":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","month":4,"page":"2293-301","pubDate":"2001-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11304783","summary":"OBJECTIVE: To assess thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) phenotype and genotype in patients who were intolerant to treatment with mercaptopurine (MP) or azathioprine (AZA), and to evaluate their clinical management.\n\nMETHODS: TPMT phenotype and thiopurine metabolism were assessed in all patients referred between 1994 and 1999 for evaluation of excessive toxicity while receiving MP or AZA.

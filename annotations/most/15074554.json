Dosing was guided by measuring thiopurine methyltransferase (for UK patients) or thioguanine nucleotides and methyl-6MP (Australian patients). Response was monitored by clinical activity indices.\n\nRESULTS: Of 41 patients, 25 had non-hepatic and 16 had hepatitic reactions. Clinical remission was achieved in 32 patients (78%) with a median follow-up of 41 weeks (range 0.5-400). Patients who did not respond to combination therapy tended to fail early with the same adverse reaction.

They were not taking any drugs interfering with azathioprine metabolism. Four visits every 4 weeks were held over a 3-month period. Aminosalicylate administration was withdrawn after the second visit. At each visit, the blood cell count, inflammatory parameters, levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotide and the acetylated metabolite of 5-aminosalicylic acid and thiopurine methyltransferase activity were determined.\n\nRESULTS: After aminosalicylate withdrawal, mean 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels decreased significantly from 148 pmol (57-357 pmol) to 132 pmol (56-247 pmol) per 8 x 10(8) red blood cells (P=0.027), without significant changes in thiopurine methyltransferase activity or biological parameters.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study favours the existence of an interaction between azathioprine and aminosalicylates through a mechanism which remains unclear.

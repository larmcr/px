Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is important for the metabolism of AZA and influences the production of active AZA metabolites. AZA dose selection based on pharmacogenetic testing of TPMT and metabolite monitoring (MM) may offer a safety and efficacy advantage over traditional dosing strategies. We performed a decision analysis to estimate the potential costs and effectiveness of TPMT screening and MM as disease management strategies for CD.\n\nMETHODS: Strategies applying TPMT and/or MM to influence treatment decisions were compared to community care (CC). The impact on toxicity minimization and improved time to initial and sustained response was evaluated. A 1-yr model was developed from the third-party payer perspective for mild to moderately chronically active, steroid-treated CD patients. Effectiveness and toxicity defined by time to response CD activity index (CDAI <150, +/- steroids) or time to sustained response (CDAI <150, off steroids x 8 wk) and reduction in leukopenic events, respectively. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the effect of varying individual estimates from those used in the base-case analysis.\n\nRESULTS: MM, TPMT, and TPMT + MM strategies as compared to CC achieved an earlier time to initial response (18.66, 18.96, and 19.10 vs. 22.41 wk, respectively) and sustained response (39.83, 42.91, and 39.8 vs. 45.36 wk, respectively). The least costly strategy at 1 yr was TPMT ($3,861) and the most costly strategy was CC ($7,142).

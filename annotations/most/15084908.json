Patients with intermediate activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT(IA)) have higher cytosol 6-thioguanine nucleotide levels. We investigated toxicity following HD-MTX during MTX/6MP maintenance therapy in relation to 6MP and TPMT.\n\nMETHODS: Using linear mixed models, we explored myelo- and hepatotoxicity in relation to 6MP dosage and TPMT phenotype following 1,749 HD-MTX courses to 411 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on maintenance therapy.\n\nRESULTS: The degree of myelosuppression following HD-MTX was similar for patients with TPMT(IA) and patients with high TPMT activity (TPMT(HA)), when HD-MTX started with same blood counts and 6MP doses. However, since TPMT(IA) had lower blood counts at initiation of HD-MTX compared with TPMT(HA) patients (median WBC 2.8 vs. 3.3 × 10⁹/L, P = 0.01; median ANC 1.4 vs. 1.7 × 10⁹/L, P = 0.02), TPMT(IA) continued to have lower WBC and ANC levels compared with TPMT(HA) during all 28 days after HD-MTX [relative difference 9 % (95 % CI 2-17), P = 0.02 and 21 % (95 % CI 6-39), P = 0.005]. Still, the fractional decrease in WBC and ANC levels after HD-MTX did not differ between TPMT(IA) and TPMT(HA) patients (P = 0.47; P = 0.38). The degree of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and rise in aminotransferases were all significantly related to 6MP dose (P < 0.001 for all analyses).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: For both TPMT(IA) and TPMT(HA) patients, dose of 6MP prior to HD-MTX should be guided by pre-HD-MTX blood counts, but not by TPMT activity.","type":"article","volume":"75","xrefs":[{"id":1449294894,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25347948","xrefId":"25347948"},{"id":1449294896,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00280-014-2613-7","xrefId":"10.1007/s00280-014-2613-7"},{"id":1449294895,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446052","xrefId":"PMC4446052"}],"year":2015},"related":{"GENE":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA356","symbol":"TPMT","name":"thiopurine S-methyltransferase"}],"DISEASE":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446155","name":"Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"}],"CHEMICAL":[{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450428","name":"methotrexate"}]},"variantAnnotations":[{"cases":411,"characteristics":"NOPHO-ALL92; p-value is for significance in the difference between the fractional (proportional) decrease in WBC in the TPMT IM phenotype versus the EM phenotype.

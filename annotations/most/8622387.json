We describe a case of severe thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency (activity less than 1 U/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes) in a young girl with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The level of 6-thioguanine nucleotide in the patient's erythrocytes was seven times the population median value, and she had intolerable hematologic toxic effects during postremission therapy with a standard dosage of mercaptopurine (75 mg/m2 per day). Subsequent therapy with 6% of this dosage (10 mg/m2 three times weekly) yielded erythrocytic 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations consistently above the population median but not associated with prohibitively toxic effects.

This leukopenia is associated with genetic variation in TPMT (encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase). Despite a lower frequency of TPMT mutations in Asians, the incidence of thiopurine-induced leukopenia is higher in Asians than in individuals of European descent. Here we performed an Immunochip-based 2-stage association study in 978 Korean subjects with Crohn's disease treated with thiopurines. We identified a nonsynonymous SNP in NUDT15 (encoding p.Arg139Cys) that was strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (odds ratio (OR) = 35.6; P(combined) = 4.88 × 10(-94)). In Koreans, this variant demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 89.4% and 93.2%, respectively, for thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (in comparison to 12.1% and 97.6% for TPMT variants). Although rare, this SNP was also strongly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease of European descent (OR = 9.50; P = 4.64 × 10(-4)). Thus, NUDT15 is a pharmacogenetic determinant for thiopurine-induced leukopenia in diverse populations.","type":"article","volume":"46","xrefs":[{"id":1449282068,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108385","xrefId":"25108385"},{"id":1449282070,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fng.3060","xrefId":"10.1038/ng.3060"},{"id":1449282069,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4999337","xrefId":"PMC4999337"}],"year":2014},"related":{"GENE":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA134963132","symbol":"NUDT15","name":"nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif 15"}],"DISEASE":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA443815","name":"Crohn Disease"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446116","name":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"},{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA444773","name":"Leukopenia"}],"CHEMICAL":[{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"},{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"}]},"relationships":[{"id":1184514089,"history":[],"literature":[{"id":15079941,"resourceId":"25108385","title":"A common missense variant in NUDT15 confers susceptibility to thiopurine-induced leukopenia.","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108385","type":"article"}],"object1s":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA134963132","symbol":"NUDT15","name":"nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif 15"}],"object2s":[{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA448515","name":"azathioprine"}],"operator1":"and","operator2":"and","related":true,"terms":[{"id":769229935,"resource":"Phenotype Categories","term":"toxicity","termId":"secondaryCat:769229935"}]}],"variantAnnotations":[{"cases":307,"characteristics":"Discovery cohort.

However, the comparable rates of 6-MP myelotoxicity, but rarity of TPMT variants, in Asians suggest that major determinants have yet to be discovered in this population. We genotyped 92 Japanese paediatric ALL patients for NUDT15 rs116855232, a 6-MP toxicity-related locus discovered in Asians. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to evaluate its association with leucopenia, hepatotoxicity, 6-MP dose reduction, therapy interruption and event-free survival. The allele frequency of rs116855232 was 0·16, and leucopenia was more common in carriers of the T allele (odds ratio, 7·20; 95% confidence interval, 2·49-20·80; P = 2·7 × 10(-4) ). As leucopenia results in 6-MP dose reduction, we observed average doses during maintenance therapy of 40·7, 29·3 and 8·8 mg/m(2) for patients with CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively (P < 0·001). Hepatotoxicity was observed only in CC genotype patients. Event-free survival did not significantly differ by NUDT15 genotype. rs116855232 is an important determinant of 6-MP myelotoxicity in Japanese children with ALL and may represent the most robust toxicity-related locus in Asians to date. Considerations for clinical application may be warranted.","type":"article","volume":"171","xrefs":[{"id":1449286794,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26033531","xrefId":"26033531"},{"id":1449286795,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fbjh.13518","xrefId":"10.1111/bjh.13518"}],"year":2015},"related":{"GENE":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA134963132","symbol":"NUDT15","name":"nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X)-type motif 15"}],"DISEASE":[{"objCls":"Disease","id":"PA446155","name":"Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma"}],"CHEMICAL":[{"objCls":"Chemical","id":"PA450379","name":"mercaptopurine"}]},"variantAnnotations":[{"cases":92,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1447682603,"literature":"26033531","literatureUrl":"/pmid/26033531","phenotypeCategories":["toxicity"],"pvalue":"2.7E-4","race":"Asian","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]},{"cases":92,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1447682616,"literature":"26033531","literatureUrl":"/pmid/26033531","phenotypeCategories":["toxicity"],"race":"Asian","significance":"not stated","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]},{"cases":92,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1447682626,"literature":"26033531","literatureUrl":"/pmid/26033531","phenotypeCategories":["dosage"],"pvalue":"0.002","race":"Asian","significance":"yes","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]},{"cases":92,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1447682637,"literature":"26033531","literatureUrl":"/pmid/26033531","phenotypeCategories":["other"],"pvalue":"0.479","race":"Asian","significance":"no","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]},{"cases":92,"chemicals":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"mercaptopurine","url":"/chemical/PA450379"}],"genes":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"NUDT15","url":"/gene/PA134963132"}],"id":1447682662,"literature":"26033531","literatureUrl":"/pmid/26033531","phenotypeCategories":["efficacy"],"pvalue":"0.279","race":"Asian","significance":"no","variants":[{"current":true,"resource":"PharmGKB","text":"rs116855232","url":"/variant/PA166154759"}]}]}

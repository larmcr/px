A single-nucleotide polymorphism in human MRP4 (rs3765534) dramatically reduces MRP4 function and results in the intracellular accumulation of 6-TGN. In this study, we investigated the association between MRP4 G2269A polymorphism and thiopurine sensitivity in Japanese IBD patients.\n\nMETHODS: Direct sequencing of the MRP4 exon 18 was performed. The TPMT A719G and ITPase C94A polymorphisms were determined by polymerase-chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 279 samples analyzed (44 healthy volunteers and 235 IBD patients), 68 samples showed a heterozygote of MRP4 G2269A and 7 carried a homozygote. The allelic frequency of MRP4 G2269A was 14.7%. In 130 IBD patients treated with azathioprine/6-MP, the white blood cell count was significantly lower in patients with theMRP4 variant alone (n = 26) than in patients with a wild allelotype (n = 74) (P = 0.014) or in patients with the ITPase variant alone (n = 22) (P = 0.0095). The 6-TGN levels were significantly higher in patients with the MRP4 variant alone than in patients with the wild allelotype(P = 0.049). Of the 15 patients who experienced leucopenia (<3 x 10⁹/l), 7 patients carried the MRP4 variant.The odds ratio of carrying the MRP4 variant alone and having leukopenia was 3.30 (95% confidence interval 1.03-10.57, P = 0.036).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MRP4 G2269A might be a new factor accounting for thiopurine sensitivity in Japanese patients with IBD.","type":"article","volume":"45","xrefs":[{"id":1449265454,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393862","xrefId":"20393862"},{"id":1449265455,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00535-010-0248-y","xrefId":"10.1007/s00535-010-0248-y"}],"year":2010},"relatedObjects":[{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA29973","symbol":"ITPA","name":"inosine triphosphatase (nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphatase)"},{"objCls":"Gene","id":"PA356","symbol":"TPMT","name":"thiopurine S-methyltransferase"}]},"publication":{"id":14673148,"resourceId":"20393862","title":"The multidrug-resistance protein 4 polymorphism is a new factor accounting for thiopurine sensitivity in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease.","authors":["Ban Hiromistu","Andoh Akira","Imaeda Hirotsugu","Kobori Ayako","Bamba Shigeki","Tsujikawa Tomoyuki","Sasaki Masaya","Saito Yasuharu","Fujiyama Yoshihide"],"journal":"Journal of gastroenterology","month":10,"page":"1014-21","pubDate":"2010-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393862","summary":"BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) functions as an efflux pump of nucleoside monophosphate analogs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN).

With conventional thiopurine doses, homozygous TPMT-deficient patients (~1 in 178 to 1 in 3,736 individuals with two nonfunctional TPMT alleles) experience severe myelosuppression, 30-60% of individuals who are heterozygotes (~3-14% of the population) show moderate toxicity, and homozygous wild-type individuals (~86-97% of the population) show lower active thioguanine nucleolides and less myelosuppression. We provide dosing recommendations (updates at http://www.pharmgkb.org) for azathioprine, mercaptopurine (MP), and thioguanine based on TPMT genotype.","type":"article","volume":"89","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/21270794","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":769164748,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21270794","xrefId":"21270794"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1038/clpt.2010.320","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449245875,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fclpt.2010.320","xrefId":"10.1038/clpt.2010.320"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC3098761","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449245874,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098761","xrefId":"PMC3098761"}],"year":2011}

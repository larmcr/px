Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.0. Sub-analysis/sensitivity analysis was also performed.\n\nRESULTS: Nine studies that investigated a total of 1309 participants met our inclusion criteria. The incidence of TPMT gene mutation was increased 2.93-fold (95% CI: 1.68-5.09, P = 0.0001) and 5.93-fold (95% CI: 2.96-11.88, P < 0.00001), respectively, in IBD patients with thiopurine-induced overall ADRs and bone marrow toxicity (BMT), compared with controls. The OR for TPMT gene mutation in IBD patients with thiopurine-induced hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis was 1.51 (95% CI: 0.54-4.19, P = 0.43) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.26-3.99, P = 0.98) vs controls, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the TPMT polymorphisms are associated with thiopurine-induced overall ADRs and BMT, but not with hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis.","type":"article","volume":"16","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/20593505","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280711,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20593505","xrefId":"20593505"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC2896757","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280712,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896757","xrefId":"PMC2896757"}],"year":2010}

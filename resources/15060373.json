The aim of this study was to investigate TPMT phenotype-genotype concordance in ALL, and the influence of TPMT on thiopurine metabolite formation.\n\nMETHODS: We measured TPMT (activity, as units ml(-1) packed RBCs and genotype) at diagnosis (n = 1150) and TPMT and thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) and methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (MeMPN) metabolites (pmol/8 × 10(8) RBCs) during chemotherapy (n = 1131) in children randomized to thioguanine or mercaptopurine on the United Kingdom trial ALL97.\n\nRESULTS: Median TPMT activity at diagnosis (8.5 units) was significantly lower than during chemotherapy (13.8 units, median difference 5.1 units, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8, 5.4, P < 0.0001). At diagnosis genotype-phenotype was discordant. During chemotherapy the overall concordance was 92%, but this fell to 55% in the intermediate activity cohort (45% had wild-type genotypes). For both thiopurines TGN concentrations differed by TPMT status. For mercaptopurine, median TGNs were higher in TPMT heterozygous genotype (754 pmol) than wild-type (360 pmol) patients (median difference 406 pmol, 95% CI 332, 478, P < 0.0001), whilst median MeMPNs, products of the TPMT reaction, were higher in wild-type (10 650 pmol) than heterozygous patients (3868 pmol) (P < 0.0001). In TPMT intermediate activity patients with a wild-type genotype, TGN (median 366 pmol) and MeMPN (median 8590 pmol) concentrations were similar to those in wild-type, high activity patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In childhood ALL, TPMT activity should not be used to predict heterozygosity particularly in blood samples obtained at disease diagnosis. Genotype is a better predictor of TGN accumulation during chemotherapy.","type":"article","volume":"76","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/23252716","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449276979,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23252716","xrefId":"23252716"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1111/bcp.12066","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449276981,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fbcp.12066","xrefId":"10.1111/bcp.12066"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC3703235","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449276980,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703235","xrefId":"PMC3703235"}],"year":2013}

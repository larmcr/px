The TPMT activity was determined at inclusion (>5 U/mL required). Azathioprine metabolites [6TGN, 6-methyl-mercaptopurine ribonucleotides (6MMP), and 6TGN/6MMP and 6TGN/TPMT ratios] were periodically monitored during steroid tapering and after withdrawal for 6 months or until a new flare occurred.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 113 patients were analysed (62% clinical response). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) relating clinical response and metabolite levels at 2, 4 and 6 months after steroid withdrawal were less than 0.7. The AUCs relating final response and initial TPMT activity or metabolite concentrations at 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks after starting thiopurines were less than 0.7. No cut-off point with worthwhile sensitivity/specificity was found. Eight (7%) patients developed thiopurine-related toxicity that could not be linked to TPMT activity or 6TGN levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support determination of TPMT activity or 6TGN concentrations to predict treatment outcome, and no useful serum metabolites threshold value to adjust the drug's dose was identified.","type":"article","volume":"34","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/21722149","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280636,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21722149","xrefId":"21722149"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04756.x","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280637,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1365-2036.2011.04756.x","xrefId":"10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04756.x"}],"year":2011}

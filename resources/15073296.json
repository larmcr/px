The allele frequency of TPMT mutation in the SLE group (2.9%) was higher than that in 174 Japanese healthy volunteers (1.1%), although it did not reach statistically significant difference (p=0.23). The mean value of TPMT activities in 51 subjects with TPMT*1/*1 was 40% higher than that of 4 subjects with TPMT*1/*3C in SLE group (18.1+/-6.1 nmol/h/ml packed red blood cells (pRBC) versus 13.2+/-3.2 nmol/h/ml pRBC; p=0.11). Two out of 4 SLE patients with TPMT*1/*3C had been treated with AZA, and one patient showed a leucopenia. The TPMT genotyping before AZA treatment is recommended for Japanese SLE patient group to avoid the AZA-induced adverse events, although detection of the patient with low TPMT activity by genotyping is still imperfect.","type":"article","volume":"28","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/16272700","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280326,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16272700","xrefId":"16272700"}],"year":2005}

Therefore, the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy established the Pharmacogenetics Working Group with the objective of developing pharmacogenetics-based therapeutic (dose) recommendations. After systematic review of the literature, recommendations were developed for 53 drugs associated with genes coding for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), HLA-B44, HLA-B*5701, CYP3A5, and factor V Leiden (FVL).","type":"article","volume":"89","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/21412232","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":769250885,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21412232","xrefId":"21412232"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1038/clpt.2011.34","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449247827,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fclpt.2011.34","xrefId":"10.1038/clpt.2011.34"}],"year":2011}

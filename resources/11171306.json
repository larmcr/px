ITPase deficiency is a clinically benign autosomal recessive condition characterised by the abnormal accumulation of ITP in erythrocytes. A deficiency of ITPase may predict adverse reactions to therapy with the thiopurine drug 6-mercaptopurine and its prodrug azathioprine. In this study, we examine the frequencies of ITPA polymorphisms in 100 healthy Japanese individuals. The allele frequency of the 94C > A variant in the Japanese sample was 0.135 (Caucasian allele frequency 0.06). The IV2 + 21A > C polymorphism was not found in Japanese (Caucasian allele frequency 0.130). Allele frequencies of the 138G > A, 561G > A and 708G > A polymorphisms were 0.57, 0.18 and 0.06 respectively in the Japanese population, and with the exception of the 138G > A polymorphism, similar to allele frequencies in Caucasians.","type":"article","volume":"23","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/15571266","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":74608025,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15571266","xrefId":"15571266"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1081/NCN-200027641","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449257287,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1081%2FNCN-200027641","xrefId":"10.1081/NCN-200027641"}],"year":2004}

TPMT is genetically polymorphic and is associated with large interindividual variations in thiopurine drug toxicity and therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we performed an in-vitro analysis of TPMT variant alleles, namely, TPMT*2, *3A, *3B, *3C, *5, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10, *11, *12, *13, *14, *16, *17, *18, *19, *20, *21, *22, *23, and *24.\n\nMETHODS: The wild-type TPMT proteins, TPMT.1 and 23 variants were heterologously expressed in COS-7 cells, and the kinetic parameters Km, Vmax, and intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) of 6-thioguanine S-methylation were determined.\n\nRESULTS: The expression levels of TPMT.2, TPMT.3A, TPMT.5, TPMT.12, TPMT.14, and TPMT.22 were considerably lower than that of TPMT.1 (P<0.005), and that of TPMT.18 was slightly reduced (P<0.05). The kinetic parameters of TPMT.3A, TPMT.3B, TPMT.5, TPMT.14, TPMT.18, TPMT.21, and TPMT.22 could not be accurately established because of no activity in 6-thioguanine S-methylation. The Vmax/Km values of TPMT.2, TPMT.7, TPMT.17, and TPMT.24 were displayed less than 10% of the wild-type.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This functional analysis with respect to TPMT variants could provide useful information for individualization of thiopurine drugs therapy.","type":"article","volume":"18","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/18708949","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":552821818,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18708949","xrefId":"18708949"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283097328","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449250530,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2FFPC.0b013e3283097328","xrefId":"10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283097328"}],"year":2008}

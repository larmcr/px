However, their molecular mechanism of action is unknown. In the present study, we have identified a unique and unexpected role for azathioprine and its metabolites in the control of T cell apoptosis by modulation of Rac1 activation upon CD28 costimulation. We found that azathioprine and its metabolites induced apoptosis of T cells from patients with Crohn disease and control patients. Apoptosis induction required costimulation with CD28 and was mediated by specific blockade of Rac1 activation through binding of azathioprine-generated 6-thioguanine triphosphate (6-Thio-GTP) to Rac1 instead of GTP. The activation of Rac1 target genes such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), NF-kappaB, and bcl-x(L) was suppressed by azathioprine, leading to a mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Azathioprine thus converts a costimulatory signal into an apoptotic signal by modulating Rac1 activity. These findings explain the immunosuppressive effects of azathioprine and suggest that 6-Thio-GTP derivates may be useful as potent immunosuppressive agents in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation.","type":"article","volume":"111","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/12697733","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":556513295,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12697733","xrefId":"12697733"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1172/JCI16432","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449251477,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1172%2FJCI16432","xrefId":"10.1172/JCI16432"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC152932","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449251476,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC152932","xrefId":"PMC152932"}],"year":2003}

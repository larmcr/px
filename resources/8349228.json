Genetic variations in nucleoside-derived drug transporter proteins encoded by the gene families SLC15, SLC22, SLC28, SLC29, ABCB, ABCC and ABCG will be specifically considered. Variants known to affect biological function are summarized, with a particular emphasis on those for which clinical correlations have already been established. Given that relatively little is known regarding the genetic variability of the players involved in determining nucleoside-derived drug bioavailability, it is anticipated that major challenges will be faced in this area of research.","type":"article","volume":"11","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/20504255","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":570459253,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20504255","xrefId":"20504255"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.2217/pgs.10.70","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449250838,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2217%2Fpgs.10.70","xrefId":"10.2217/pgs.10.70"}],"year":2010}

We hypothesized that this association may also be present in a larger, population-based group of inflammatory bowel disease patients intolerant of thiopurine drugs. We performed genotyping for this polymorphism and TPMT*2 and TPMT*3 in 73 such patients and 74 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have tolerated azathioprine. We could not demonstrate a significant association between the ITPA94C>A genotype and any adverse effects (Odds ratio (OR) 1.015, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.360-2.867, P = 0.593), flu-like symptoms (OR 1.547, 95%CI 0.368-6.496, P = 0.398), rash (no ITPA 94C>A polymorphism identified) or pancreatitis (no ITPA 94C>A polymorphism identified). We found no significant association between the ITPA 94C>A polymorphism and adverse effects to thiopurine drugs.","type":"article","volume":"14","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/15564886","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":57134937,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564886","xrefId":"15564886"}],"year":2004}

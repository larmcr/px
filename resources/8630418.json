This trial compared the efficacy and toxicity of thioguanine (INN, thioguanine) versus mercaptopurine.\n\nMETHODS: Consecutive children were randomized to receive thioguanine or mercaptopurine during maintenance chemotherapy. Toxicity data were collected by an adverse event-reporting system with follow-up questionnaires. Red blood cell thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity and thioguanine nucleotide concentrations were measured by standard techniques.\n\nRESULTS: Of the children, 748 were randomized to thioguanine and 744 were randomized to mercaptopurine. There was no difference in the event-free survival rate between the 2 groups (80% and 81%, respectively, at 5 years). Thioguanine was associated with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver in 95 children, and persistent splenomegaly as a result of portal hypertension developed in 43 children. TPMT activity was significantly lower in the children in whom VOD developed, with a median of 13.4 U (range, 5.8-23 U) compared with 15.2 U (range, 5.3-27) in a control group of 161 leukemia patients in whom VOD did not develop (median difference, 1.8 U; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.7 U; P = .0001). TPMT activity in children with persistent splenomegaly was also lower than that in control subjects (median difference, 1.6 U; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-2.8 U; P = .012). There was no difference in red blood cell thioguanine nucleotide concentrations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Thioguanine was associated with liver damage in 11% of children randomized to thioguanine without an improvement in event-free survival rate. The association of lower TPMT activity with thioguanine-related liver damage could provide a means of identifying at-risk patients.","type":"article","volume":"80","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/17015055","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":144985157,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015055","xrefId":"17015055"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1016/j.clpt.2006.07.002","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449251517,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.clpt.2006.07.002","xrefId":"10.1016/j.clpt.2006.07.002"}],"year":2006}

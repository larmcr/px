The TPMT*27 variant allozyme showed a striking decrease in both immunoreactive protein level and enzyme activity after transient expression in a mammalian cell line. We set out to explore the mechanism(s) responsible for decreased expression of this novel variant of an important drug-metabolizing enzyme. We observed accelerated degradation of TPMT*27 protein in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. TPMT*27 degradation was slowed by proteasome inhibition and involved chaperone proteins-similar to observations with regard to the degradation of the common TPMT*3A variant allozyme. TPMT*27 aggresome formation was also observed in transfected mammalian cells after proteasome inhibition. Inhibition of autophagy also decreased TPMT*27 degradation. Finally, structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulation indicated that TPMT*27 was less stable than was the wild type TPMT allozyme. In summary, TPMT*27 serves to illustrate the potential importance of protein degradation - both proteasome and autophagy-mediated degradation - for the pharmacogenetic effects of nonsynonymous SNPs.","type":"article","volume":"79","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/19945438","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":569550586,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19945438","xrefId":"19945438"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1016/j.bcp.2009.11.016","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449247437,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bcp.2009.11.016","xrefId":"10.1016/j.bcp.2009.11.016"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC2815203","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449247436,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2815203","xrefId":"PMC2815203"}],"year":2010}

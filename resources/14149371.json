Owing to polymorphisms in the TPMT gene (TPMT*2-*22), the enzyme activity varies interindividually. Patients with reduced TPMT activity may develop adverse reactions when treated with standard doses of thiopurines. This work focuses on a TPMT genotype/phenotype discrepancy found in a patient during routine testing. The patient displayed very low TPMT enzyme activity and she was genotyped by pyrosequencing as being heterozygous for the 460G>A and 719A>G polymorphisms (TPMT*3A). Complete sequencing in combination with haplotyping of the TPMT gene revealed a novel sequence variant, 500C>G, on one allele and TPMT*3A on the other allele, giving rise to the novel genotype TPMT*3A/*23. When investigating the patient's relatives, they too had the TPMT*3A/*23 genotype in combination with low enzyme activity. We conclude that this novel variant allele affects enzyme activity, as the individuals carrying it had almost undetectable TPMT activity.","type":"article","volume":"17","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/17885628","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449263235,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17885628","xrefId":"17885628"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1097/FPC.0b013e3282ef642b","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449263236,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2FFPC.0b013e3282ef642b","xrefId":"10.1097/FPC.0b013e3282ef642b"}],"year":2007}

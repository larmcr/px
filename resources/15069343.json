It is therefore of value to know an individual's inherent capacity to express TPMT.\n\nMETHODS: We developed a pyrosequencing method to detect 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TPMT. A Swedish population (n = 800) was examined for TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, TPMT*3C, and TPMT*2. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 24) and healthy volunteers (n = 6), selected on the basis of TPMT enzymatic activity, were investigated for all 10 SNPs to determine the relationship between TPMT genotype and phenotype.\n\nRESULTS: In the general population we identified the following genotypes with nonfunctional alleles: TPMT*1/*3A (*3A allelic frequency, 3.75%), TPMT*1/*3C (*3C allelic frequency, 0.44%), TPMT*1/*3B (*3B allelic frequency, 0.13%), and TPMT*1/*2 (*2 allelic frequency, 0.06%). All nine individuals with normal enzymatic activity were wild-type TPMT*1/*1. Thirteen individuals with intermediate activity were either TPMT*1/*3A (n = 12) or TPMT*1/*2 (n = 1). Eight individuals with low enzymatic activity were TPMT*3A/*3A (n = 4), TPMT*3A/*3C (n = 2), or TPMT*1/*3A (n = 2).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Next to wild type, the most frequent alleles in Sweden are TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C. A previously established phenotypic cutoff for distinguishing normal from intermediate metabolizers was confirmed. To identify the majority of cases (90%) with low or intermediate TPMT activity, it was sufficient to analyze individuals for only 3 of the 10 SNPs investigated. Nevertheless, this investigation indicates that other mutations might be of relevance for decreased enzymatic activity.","type":"article","volume":"50","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/14656901","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279255,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14656901","xrefId":"14656901"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1373/clinchem.2003.023846","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279256,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1373%2Fclinchem.2003.023846","xrefId":"10.1373/clinchem.2003.023846"}],"year":2004}

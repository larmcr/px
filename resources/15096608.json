Meanwhile, patient genome analysis is being employed across therapeutic areas to inform selection of appropriate drugs and doses for treatment safety. Integration of patient genome analysis concurrent with preemptive tumor genetic testing will enable oncologists to make informed treatment decisions to select the right dose of the right drug for each patient and their tumor.","type":"article","volume":"99","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/26537014","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449284247,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26537014","xrefId":"26537014"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1002/cpt.294","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449284248,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fcpt.294","xrefId":"10.1002/cpt.294"}],"year":2016}

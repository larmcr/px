Mutations in the TPMT gene may influence the efficacy and safety of 6-MP treatment. This multicenter study investigated the association between TPMT genotype, 6-MP dose adjustments, and the incidence of adverse effects in patients.\n\nMETHODS: A total of 203 ALL children were genotyped using PCR/allele-specific amplification and PCR/RFLP. The control group consisted of 394 healthy volunteers.\n\nRESULTS: The TPMT*3A variant allele was found in 16 patients (15 TPMT*1/*3A, 1 TPMT*3A/*3A) and the TPMT*3C (A719G) allele in 1 patient. No TPMT*2 (G238C) or TPMT*3B (G460A) alleles were detected in the study group. TPMT*3A, TPMT*1 (wild-type), and TPMT*3C alleles were detected at frequencies of 3.94%, 95.81%, and 0.25%, respectively. The genotype and allele distributions were similar in the ALL and control groups. The 6-MP dose was reduced more frequently in patients with TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C alleles, compared with wild-type alleles (P = 0.042). Reductions because of leucopenia with respiratory tract infection, or because of leucopenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia were four (P = 0.007) and five (P = 0.03) times more common, respectively. The groups differed with regard to the rates of 6-MP dose reduction (P = 0.028). 6-MP was discontinued more often in patients with TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C alleles (14-fold) as a result of leucopenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia (P = 0.004).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TPMT genotype influences the safety and efficacy of ALL treatment and genotype information may therefore be useful for optimizing 6-MP therapy.","type":"article","volume":"57","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/21319286","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449282149,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21319286","xrefId":"21319286"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1002/pbc.23013","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449282150,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fpbc.23013","xrefId":"10.1002/pbc.23013"}],"year":2011}

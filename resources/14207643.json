It was focused on practical applications in routine medical practice. We provide practical recommendations for ten different clinical situations, that have either been approved or not approved by regulatory agencies. We propose some comments that might accompany the results of these tests, indicating the best drug and doses to be prescribed. The discussed examples include KRAS, cetuximab, panitumumab, EGFR-gefitinib, CYP2D6-tamoxifen, TPMT-azathioprine-6-mercaptopurine, VKORC1/CYP2C9-warfarin, CYP2C19-clopidogrel, HLA-B*5701-abacavir, HLA-B*5701-flucloxacillin, SLCO1B1-statins and CYP3A5-tacrolimus. We hope that these practical recommendations will help physicians, biologists, scientists and other healthcare professionals to prescribe, perform and interpret these genetic tests.","type":"article","volume":"12","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/21174626","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":827784030,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21174626","xrefId":"21174626"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.2217/pgs.10.147","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449263440,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2217%2Fpgs.10.147","xrefId":"10.2217/pgs.10.147"}],"year":2011}

Mutations in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) genes have been associated with the occurrence of AZA-related toxicity. The aim of our study was to determine the relative contribution of ITPA and TPMT mutations to the development of toxicity induced by AZA treatment in IBD patients.\n\nMETHODS: ITPA(94C>A, IVS2+21A>C) and TPMT (238G>C, 460G>A, and 719A>G) genotypes were assessed in 262 IBD patients (159 females, 103 males; 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, 195 patients with Crohn's disease) treated with AZA and were correlated with the development of leukopenia and hepatotoxicity.\n\nRESULTS: Leukopenia (leukocyte count, <3.0 x 10(9)/L) was observed in 4.6% of treated patients. The frequencies of mutant ITPA 94C>A and TPMT alleles were significantly higher in the leukopenic population compared with patients without leukopenia (16.7% and 5.4%, respectively, for ITPA 94C>A, and 20.8% and 4%, respectively, for TPMT). Moreover, the ITPA 94C>A and TPMT mutations predicted leukopenia: ITPA 94C>A odds ratio, 3.504; 95% confidence interval, 1.119-10.971 (P = .046); TPMT odds ratio, 6.316; 95% confidence interval, 2.141-18.634 (P = .004). Neither TPMT nor ITPA genotype predicted hepatotoxicity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: ITPA 94C>A and TPMT polymorphisms are associated with AZA-related leukopenia in IBD patients.","type":"article","volume":"4","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/16431304","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280481,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16431304","xrefId":"16431304"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1016/j.cgh.2005.10.019","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280482,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cgh.2005.10.019","xrefId":"10.1016/j.cgh.2005.10.019"}],"year":2006}

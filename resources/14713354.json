All patients were screened for seven genetic polymorphisms in three enzymes involved in mercaptopurine metabolism [xanthine oxidase, inosine triphosphatase (C94-->A and IVS2+21A-->C) and thiopurine methyltransferase]. Erythrocyte and plasma metabolite concentrations were also determined. The associations between the various genotypes and myelotoxicity, haematological parameters and metabolite concentrations were determined.\n\nRESULTS: Thiopurine methyltransferase variant alleles were associated with a preferential metabolism away from 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (P = 0.008 in ALL patients, P = 0.038 in IBD patients) favouring 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) (P = 0.021 in ALL patients). Interestingly, carriers of inosine triphosphatase IVS2+21A-->C variants among ALL and IBD patients had significantly higher concentrations of the active cytotoxic metabolites, 6-TGNs (P = 0.008 in ALL patients, P = 0.047 in IBD patients). The study confirmed the association of thiopurine methyltransferase heterozygosity with leucopenia and neutropenia in ALL patients and reported a significant association between inosine triphosphatase IVS2+21A-->C variants with thrombocytopenia (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS; Pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in the 6-MP pathway may help identify patients at risk for associated toxicities and may serve as a guide for dose individualization.","type":"article","volume":"66","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/18662289","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449265767,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18662289","xrefId":"18662289"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03248.x","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449265769,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1365-2125.2008.03248.x","xrefId":"10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03248.x"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC2561120","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449265768,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561120","xrefId":"PMC2561120"}],"year":2008}

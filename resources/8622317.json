They were monitored with haematological parameters and red blood cell concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (E-6TGN) and methotrexate (E-MTX, including MTX polyglutamates), in relation to the doses of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX), during their maintenance chemotherapy. Both patients developed severe pancytopenia at the standard protocol dose of 6MP. Even at 25% and 5%, respectively, of the protocol dose of 6MP, they achieved E-6TGN values several-fold above the population median, but without unacceptable bone-marrow toxicity. Their high E-6TGN values had only a minor influence on their E-MTX values and their tolerance to oral MTX, but severe pancytopenia followed high-dose MTX infusions. Due to the risk of fatal myelosuppression we recommend up-front determination of TPMT activity in patients treated with 6MP or azathioprine.","type":"article","volume":"87","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/9510461","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":124627,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9510461","xrefId":"9510461"}],"year":1998}

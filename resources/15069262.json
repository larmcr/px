We focused on patients who experienced leucopenia caused by high blood levels of active azathioprine metabolites.\n\nMETHODS: Our group consists of 87 patients who have been treated by azathioprine. 21 individuals experienced leucopenia during treatment with standard dose of azathioprine. We have used PCR-REA and \"real-time\" PCR methods for genotype detection G238C, G460G and A719G substitutions in TPMT gene.\n\nRESULTS: We have found statistical association between the presence of non-standard TPMT alleles and adverse event associated with azathioprine treatment - leucopenia (p=0.0033).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that TPMT genotyping prior to the treatment with azathioprine could predict patients with genetic predisposition for serious leucopenia and seems to be a useful genetic marker for individualisation of the therapy.","type":"article","volume":"30 Suppl 1","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/20027160","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279238,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20027160","xrefId":"20027160"}],"year":2009}

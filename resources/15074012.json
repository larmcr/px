We sought to determine optimal therapeutic 6-MP metabolite levels and their correlation with medication-induced toxicity and TPMT genotype.\n\nMETHODS: Therapeutic response was determined in 92 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease coincidentally with hematologic, pancreatic, and hepatic laboratory parameters, and compared with erythrocyte metabolite levels and TPMT genotype.\n\nRESULTS: Clinical response was highly correlated with 6-TG levels (P < 0.0001) but not with any other variable, including 6-MMP levels, drug dose, gender, and concurrent medications. The frequency of therapeutic response increased at 6-TG levels > 235 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes (P < 0.001). Hepatotoxicity correlated with elevated 6-MMP levels (>5700 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes; P < 0.05). Although leukopenia was associated with higher 6-TG levels (P < 0.03), it was observed in only 8% of responders. Patients heterozygous for TPMT (8/92) had higher 6-TG levels (P < 0.0001), and all responded to therapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: 6-MP metabolite levels and TPMT genotyping may assist clinicians in optimizing therapeutic response to 6-MP and identifying individuals at increased risk for drug-induced toxicity.","type":"article","volume":"118","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/10734022","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280497,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10734022","xrefId":"10734022"}],"year":2000}

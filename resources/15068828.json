A subset of these patients are genetically slow metabolizers due to point-mutations in enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), and are at a higher risk of hematologic toxicity and leukemogenesis. We present such a patient who was a slow metabolizer for azathioprine, and developed a rapidly lethal form acute myeloid leukemia after relatively low dose exposure to the drug. There was prominent hemophagocytic activity in the bone marrow, and cytogenetic analysis showed a complex karyotype with monosomy 7, but no involvement of chromosome 8.","type":"article","volume":"83","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/17696202","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279144,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17696202","xrefId":"17696202"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1002/ajh.21014","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279145,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fajh.21014","xrefId":"10.1002/ajh.21014"}],"year":2008}

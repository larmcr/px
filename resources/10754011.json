To date, at least 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms have been reported in the TPMT gene, 23 of these are associated with reduced enzyme activity.\n\nMETHODS: The aim of the present study was to sequence the whole coding region of TPMT (exons 3-10) to identify known and novel TPMT sequence variants amongst healthy Estonians. Erythrocyte TPMT activity was also measured to carry out a genotype-phenotype comparison.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 21 subjects were heterozygous for known TPMT alleles (*2, *3A, *3C, *9, *12). Several other previously described intronic and exon polymorphisms were identified. Three novel mutations were detected -30T>A in exon 3, 10A>G in intron 3, and 145A>G in intron 10. Association analysis revealed four markers (114T>A, 94T>A, 460G>A, 719A>G) whose frequencies were significantly different in intermediate (enzyme activity <or=60 ng/mL/h) methylators compared to normal (enzyme activity 61-139 ng/mL/h) and high (enzyme activity >or=140 ng/mL/h) methylators (p<0.001). Haplotype analysis found one haplotype to be associated with intermediate TPMT activity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results point to several markers that predict reduced enzyme activity. None of the identified markers were associated with high enzyme activity.","type":"article","volume":"46","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/18605963","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":551928452,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18605963","xrefId":"18605963"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1515/CCLM.2008.187","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449256562,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1515%2FCCLM.2008.187","xrefId":"10.1515/CCLM.2008.187"}],"year":2008}

The best-recognized examples are genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes, which affect about 30% of all drugs. Loss of function of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) results in severe and life-threatening hematopoietic toxicity if patients receive standard doses of mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Gene duplication of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6), which metabolizes many antidepressants, has been identified as a mechanism of poor response in the treatment of depression. There is also a growing list of genetic polymorphisms in drug targets that have been shown to influence drug response. A major limitation that has heretofore moderated the use of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical setting is the lack of prospective clinical trials demonstrating that such testing can improve the benefit/risk ratio of drug therapy.","type":"article","volume":"57","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/16409140","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":551449215,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16409140","xrefId":"16409140"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104724","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449254716,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1146%2Fannurev.med.56.082103.104724","xrefId":"10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104724"}],"year":2006}

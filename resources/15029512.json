Only heterozygous TPMT alleles were observed (10%, 7/71) with relative frequencies being *1/*3C (4.2%), *1/*2 (4.2%) and *1/*3A (1.4%). The median 6-mercaptopurine dose administered during the maintenance therapy was 31% lower among patients with heterozygous TPMT alleles versus the rest (32.1mg/m(2)/day and 46.2mg/m(2)/day, p=0.005), though the myelosuppression and toxicities were similar in both the groups. Identification of TPMT genotype appears to be important in making the ALL treatment more effective and less toxic.","type":"article","volume":"34","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/20153897","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449273278,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153897","xrefId":"20153897"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1016/j.leukres.2010.01.029","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449273279,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.leukres.2010.01.029","xrefId":"10.1016/j.leukres.2010.01.029"}],"year":2010}

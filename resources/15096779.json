While thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency was the first pharmacogenetic phenomenon to be recognized to influence thiopurine toxicity and reliably predict leukopenia, it does not predict other adverse effects, nor does it explain most cases of thiopurine resistance. In recent years, a number of other genetic polymorphisms have received increasing attention in the literature. In particular, SNPs in NUDT15 and in the class II HLA locus have been shown to predict thiopurine-related leukopenia and pancreatitis. The aim of this review is to provide a concise update of genetic variability which may influence patient response to azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine.","type":"article","volume":"16","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/26067482","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449286909,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26067482","xrefId":"26067482"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.2217/pgs.15.29","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449286910,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2217%2Fpgs.15.29","xrefId":"10.2217/pgs.15.29"}],"year":2015}

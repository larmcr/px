TPMT activity (range 0.17-25.93 U) displayed a trimodal distribution of high (> 11.3 U; 9% of individuals), intermediate (5-11.3 U; 9.8%) and low (0.17 U; 0.3%) phenotypes. The occurrence of the TPMT mutations 238G>C, 460G>A and 719A>G was investigated in all individuals with low or intermediate phenotype, and in 43 with high-activity phenotype. None and two mutant alleles were associated with high- or low-activity phenotypes, respectively, whereas one mutant allele was detected in 26 of the 30 intermediate phenotype individuals. The allele frequencies of TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C did not differ between individuals classed as Euro-derived (0.76%, 2.03% and 2.54%, respectively) or having interethnic admixture (0.60%, 1.81% and 1.81%, respectively). Furthermore, within each of these groups, the frequencies of TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C were not significantly different.","type":"article","volume":"13","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/12777968","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280260,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12777968","xrefId":"12777968"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1097/01.fpc.0000054091.48725.eb","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280261,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F01.fpc.0000054091.48725.eb","xrefId":"10.1097/01.fpc.0000054091.48725.eb"}],"year":2003}

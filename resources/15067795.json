Analysis of the genetic data from the first 9,589 individuals reveals that the frequency of genetic variants is concordant with published allele frequencies. Based on five currently implemented drug-gene interactions, the multiplexed test identified one or more actionable variants in 91% of the genotyped patients and in 96% of African American patients. Using medication exposure data from electronic medical records, we compared a theoretical \"reactive,\" prescription-triggered, serial single-gene testing strategy with our preemptive, multiplexed genotyping approach. Reactive genotyping would have generated 14,656 genetic tests. These data highlight three advantages of preemptive genotyping: (i) the vast majority of patients carry at least one pharmacogenetic variant; (ii) data are available at the point of care; and (iii) there is a substantial reduction in testing burden compared with a reactive strategy.","type":"article","volume":"95","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/24253661","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449278918,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253661","xrefId":"24253661"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1038/clpt.2013.229","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449278920,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fclpt.2013.229","xrefId":"10.1038/clpt.2013.229"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC3961508","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449278919,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3961508","xrefId":"PMC3961508"}],"year":2014}

Its red blood cell (RBC) metabolite concentrations (6-thioguanine [6-TGN] and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides [6-MMPN]) are related to drug response. We investigated the impact of non-genetic covariates and pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) on 6-MP metabolism and response.\n\nMETHODS: Sixty-six children with ALL treated according to EORTC 58951 protocol were included in this study. Six patients had a heterozygous genotype for the most common TPMT polymorphisms, nine for ITPA 94 C > A and 17 for ITPA IVS2+21 A > C. 6-MP metabolites concentrations were analyzed by mixed model analysis.\n\nRESULTS: During maintenance, steady-state RBC 6-TGN concentrations were lower in patients aged 6 years or younger (493 pmol/8 × 10(8) RBC) than in older children (600 pmol/8 × 10(8) RBC). 6-MMPN concentrations were low in patients with TPMT variant/wild-type ITPA (1862 pmol/8 × 10(8) RBC), intermediate in wild-type patients and high (16468 pmol/8 × 10(8) RBC) in patients wild-type TPMT/variant ITPA. A 6-MMPN threshold of 5000 pmol/8 × 10(8) RBC was associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, age and both TPMT and ITPA genotypes influenced 6-MP metabolism. High 6-MMPN was associated with hepatotoxicity. These pharmacological tools should be used to monitor ALL treatment in children.","type":"article","volume":"71","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/21395650","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280638,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21395650","xrefId":"21395650"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03867.x","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280640,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1365-2125.2010.03867.x","xrefId":"10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03867.x"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC3080646","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280639,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080646","xrefId":"PMC3080646"}],"year":2011}

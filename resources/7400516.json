Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency is known to exacerbate thiopurine toxicity. However, many patients are highly sensitive to thiopurines for unknown reasons. We show that multidrug-resistance protein 4 (Mrp4) is abundant in myeloid progenitors and tested the role of the Mrp4, an ATP transporter of monophosphorylated nucleosides, in this unexplained thiopurine sensitivity. Mrp4-deficient mice experienced Mrp4 gene dosage-dependent toxicity caused by accumulation of 6-TGNs in their myelopoietic cells. Therefore, Mrp4 protects against thiopurine-induced hematopoietic toxicity by actively exporting thiopurine nucleotides. We then identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human MRP4 (rs3765534) that dramatically reduces MRP4 function by impairing its cell membrane localization. This SNP is common (>18%) in the Japanese population and indicates that the increased sensitivity of some Japanese patients to thiopurines may reflect the greater frequency of this MRP4 SNP.","type":"article","volume":"68","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/18593894","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":551925650,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18593894","xrefId":"18593894"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6790","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449248163,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1158%2F0008-5472.CAN-07-6790","xrefId":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6790"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC3323115","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449248162,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323115","xrefId":"PMC3323115"}],"year":2008}

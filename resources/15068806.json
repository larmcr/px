At present, it is generally recommended that these patients should not receive AZA or 6-MP treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. We report for the first time that Crohn's disease patients with TPMT deficiency can be successfully treated with AZA. We illustrate this with three cases where treatment has been successful and toxicity has been avoided by carefully titrating the drug dose. Thus very low TPMT activity demands pharmacogenetically guided dosing.","type":"article","volume":"52","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/12477776","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279138,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12477776","xrefId":"12477776"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC1773505","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279139,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1773505","xrefId":"PMC1773505"}],"year":2003}

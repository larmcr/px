The Translational Pharmacogenetics Program (TPP) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pharmacogenomics Research Network was established in 2011 to catalog and contribute to the development of pharmacogenetic implementations at eight US healthcare systems, with the goal to disseminate real-world solutions for the barriers to clinical pharmacogenetic implementation. The TPP collected and normalized pharmacogenetic implementation metrics through June 2015, including gene-drug pairs implemented, interpretations of alleles and diplotypes, numbers of tests performed and actionable results, and workflow diagrams. TPP participant institutions developed diverse solutions to overcome many barriers, but the use of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines provided some consistency among the institutions. The TPP also collected some pharmacogenetic implementation outcomes (scientific, educational, financial, and informatics), which may inform healthcare systems seeking to implement their own pharmacogenetic testing programs.","type":"article","volume":"102","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/28090649","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449293464,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28090649","xrefId":"28090649"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1002/cpt.630","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449293466,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fcpt.630","xrefId":"10.1002/cpt.630"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pmc/PMC5511786","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449293465,"resource":"PubMed Central","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5511786","xrefId":"PMC5511786"}],"year":2017}

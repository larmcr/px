The following synergetic interactions appeared to increase the toxicity of 6-mercaptopurine: TPMT*12 × RFC1 G80A; TPMT CTTAT haplotype × RFC1 G80A; TPMT CTTAT haplotype × RFC1 G80A × TYMS 2R3R. The genetic variants of thiopurine and folate pathway cumulatively appeared to increase the predictability of toxicity (r(2) = 0.41) in a multiple linear regression model. For the observed toxicity grades of 1, 2, 3 and 4, the respective predicted toxicity grades were 1.65 ± 0.29, 1.68 ± 0.24, 2.56 ± 0.58 and 2.99 ± 1.03, p(trend) < 0.0001.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Gene-gene interaction between thiopurine and folate pathways inflate the 6-MP-mediated toxicity in Indian children with ALL illustrating the importance of ethnicity in the toxicity of 6-MP.","type":"article","volume":"13","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/22838948","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449268424,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22838948","xrefId":"22838948"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.2217/pgs.12.70","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449268425,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2217%2Fpgs.12.70","xrefId":"10.2217/pgs.12.70"}],"year":2012}

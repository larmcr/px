ADRs were more common in older patients (p = 0.01). There was no increase in stopping azathioprine due to ADRs in TPMT heterozygotes compared with wild-type individuals. The single individual with TPMT variant homozygosity experienced severe neutropenia.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work supports the strong evidence that individuals with TPMT variant homozygosity are at high risk of severe neutropenia, whereas TPMT heterozygotes are not at increased risk of ADRs at standard doses of azathioprine.","type":"article","volume":"12","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/21692613","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449266191,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21692613","xrefId":"21692613"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.2217/pgs.11.32","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449266192,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2217%2Fpgs.11.32","xrefId":"10.2217/pgs.11.32"}],"year":2011}

They confirm known intronic and exonic TPMT polymorphisms that do not correlate with AZA responses and demonstrate a novel intronic polymorphism in a patient intolerant to AZA. Most importantly, they show that of the 22 AZA-intolerant patients, all 5 who carried mutations of the intolerance-linked haplotype TPMT*3A also carried the intronic T140+114A (rs3931660), all 3 mutations being part of a new haplotype designated TMPT*3E. TPMT*3E was not observed in unresponsive or responsive patients. The association of TPMT*3E with AZA intolerance and its frequency must be ascertained in larger, ethnically different cohorts. Nevertheless, in view of the highly significant association (Psim = 0.0026) between TPMT*3E and AZA intolerance in the study, this new haplotype should be taken into consideration in pharmacogenetic profiling for AZA.","type":"article","volume":"53","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/23400745","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280858,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23400745","xrefId":"23400745"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1177/0091270011435989","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449280859,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F0091270011435989","xrefId":"10.1177/0091270011435989"}],"year":2013}

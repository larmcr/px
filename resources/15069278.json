TPMT activity is significantly altered by genetics, and heterozygous and even more homozygous variant people reveal substiantially decreased TPMT activity. Treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regularly includes the use of thiopurine drugs. Importantly, childhood ALL patients with low TPMT activity have been considered to be at increased risk of developing therapy-associated acute myeloid leukemia and brain tumors. In the present study, we genotyped 105 of 129 patients who developed a secondary malignant neoplasm after ALL treatment on 7 consecutive German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster trials for all functionally relevant TPMT variants. Frequencies of TPMT variants were similarly distributed in secondary malignant neoplasm patients and the overall ALL patient population of 814 patients. Thus, TPMT does not play a major role in the etiology of secondary malignant neoplasm after treatment for childhood ALL, according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster strategies.","type":"article","volume":"114","xrefs":[{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/pubMed/19535798","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279245,"resource":"PubMed","sameAs":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19535798","xrefId":"19535798"},{"@id":"https://pharmgkb.org/crossReference/doi/10.1182/blood-2008-12-193250","@context":"https://api.pharmgkb.org/jsonld/crossReference.jsonld","id":1449279246,"resource":"Digital Object Identifiers","sameAs":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1182%2Fblood-2008-12-193250","xrefId":"10.1182/blood-2008-12-193250"}],"year":2009}
